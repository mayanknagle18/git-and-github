// Git - It is a version control system, save all the history of the files and also the changes made in it. Git achieves multiple things through it. 
/* 
Git is different from GitHub
 
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Open GitBash and type
---------------------
- To check the version of Git => git --version  
2.40.1
- To set config to tell your name => git config --global user.name "Mayank Nagle"
- To set config to tell your email id => git config --global user.email "mayank.nagle19@gmail.com"
- To check whether it is actually did or not => 
for name => git config --global user.name
Mayank Nagle
for email => git config --global user.email
mayank.nagle19@gmail.com
- For editing config files.
=> git config --global --edit
insert -> edit your data
and escape after save and write :wq to exit there.

for creating git file
---------------------
- mkdir name => for making new folder.
- cd name => for change directory.
- cd d: => for changing directory to d
- cd f: => for changing directory to f
- cd .. => for returning to desktop.
- cd ~ => for goining in root directory.
- clear => for clearing data
- cd "Web Development" => Space taken inside the quotes singlr or double
- cd developemnt => without in quotes beacuse there is no space in the spacific folder

example :-
cd d: 
cd "Web Development"
cd "Git and Github"

Now we can make our repository in it. Repository means the project that can be tracked through git.

- if you want to make this folder a git repo, then write => git init
for creating a repository.
- ls => to find repository empty or not.
- ls => gives the directories in the specific drive.
- ls -a => then you can see a file .git, this file is created in it when we make a new repository. which you know that it contains the files which is being tracked by git.


Now creating a file.
- git init => if you want to make this folder a git repository.
- git status => which tells you the status about the changes made in the repository, what modifications have been done, which file have been deleted which files have been changed.
